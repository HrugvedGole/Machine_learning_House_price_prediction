# Machine_learning_House_price_prediction
This repository contains a project in which I used machine learning algorithms for predictions the price of different houses in India.

In this project, I  used a data of different houses based in different states of India. It includes data cleaning, data visualisation, data preprocessing, model building and model evaluation. I have used different models and compared their performace and chosen the best model accordingly. The data used has also been provided in this repository.
